# Gitcoin Grants Analysis G1-G12

This is a submission for the Gitcoin Bounty [here](https://gitcoin.co/issue/gitcoinco/skunkworks/252/100027341). I only
dabble in the data science world, and this was my first real shot at putting together a comprehensive analysis. It's
definitely not that mind-blowing or complex, but I enjoyed putting it together. It revealed to me that I have a lot of
learning to do in different statistical analysis tools and approaches, but that this can be rewarding work.

See the notebook [here](./main.ipynb). It seems that GitHub won't render the [pandas_profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/) analysis on their repo, so download the notebook and run it locally if you want to see it. It gives a lot of great overviews for the data.

## Lessons for Next Time

* Use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) which has a lot more features and slick interface. I discovered it late in this process, and turns out it's not easy to just drop in as a replacement for the `pandas` default plotting setup.
* Refresh and improve my statistics knowledge.
* Improve my `pandas` skills. They definitely got better through this process, but there are certain parts that I did quite naively that I'm sure could have been accomplished with better syntax and performance.
